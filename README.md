## In this file you can read about the main difference of two commands
This two commands synchronize changes in repositories.
### **Git pull**
- pulls down from a remote and instantly merges
### **Git fetch**
 - is a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository
 ### **Difference**
Git fetch is a safer alternative because it pulls in all the commits from your remote but doesn't make any changes to your local files. On the other hand, Git pull is faster as you're performing multiple actions in one.
